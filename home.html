            <div class="introduction">        
                <p>Hey there, it's Jake. Long story short, I'm a 5th year Computer Science student at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, TX.  You've probably never heard of Nac, as we call it.  I certainly hadn't until I ended up going to school there.  I'm about to start my very last semester(yay!) and graduate this coming May 2019.  My goal is to get a job/internship in Denver, CO and make my big move out to the Rockies.  I'm from Texas but grew up in Seattle for 13 years.  We moved back to Texas the summer before my senior year of high school and ever since then I have missed the mountains, snow, and colder weather.  Here is a recent picture of me on my balcony, trying to look grownup lol.</p>

                <p>Technology is a big part of my life.  When I started school at SFA, I was a Sound Recording Technology major(SRT).  I'll get to my musical interests later, but the program wasn't what I thought it would be and I knew I didn't want to continue after that first year.  That summer I had what I call an "early life crisis".  I had always known what I wanted to do growing up.  If I lost interest in one thing, it was replaced with another.  That summer of 2015 I was in limbo.  For the first time I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and I was closer to needing to know than ever.  I almost joined the Navy, except one other interest grabbed my attention.</p>
        
                <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                <p>Switching to a CS major is one of the best decisions I have ever made.  I can't imagine where I'd be right now otherwise.  My outlook is so bright! Not just getting paid well but being able to say "I love what I do".</p>

                <h1>What Would I Do Without Music</h1>
                <p>My musical journey started close to a decade ago now(as best I can recall).  I started with a guitar my Dad got himself for Christmas.  I picked up the skill way faster than he did(sorry Dad) and after a few months I moved the guitar and my amp to my room.  Not long after I was playing everyday.  Right after I got home from school I would sit down and play for one, two, or three hours on occasion.  I progressed fairly quickly and within two or three years(I can't remember), I played in the 9th grade talent show. </p>

                <p>Not too long after 9th grade I got into electronic music.  I was looking for software to record guitar in and I found a program called Ableton Live.  Once I started messing around with it I saw the incredible potential of creating songs entirely from a laptop, and my foray into producing and EDM began...</p>

            <p>Yes, that is a picture of me.  I count it as my finest photoshop and I used it for my first and only (melodic) dubstep track.  I christened myself as Aurion(oar + eon).  My Soundcloud is a collection of many of my life's greatest works.  I'm way behind Mozart, but ahead of the average millenial, and proud of it.</p>

            <p>First, I present to you, <i>Solo Magic</i>, one of my finest.  Sometimes inspiration just strikes, and that allowed me to create this gem in about two hours.</p>
